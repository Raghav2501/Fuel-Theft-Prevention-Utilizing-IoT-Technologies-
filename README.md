## 📌 Project Overview

Fuel fraud and quality issues are persistent challenges in fuel distribution. This system addresses those problems by combining sensor data, embedded processing, and cloud connectivity to monitor fuel levels, flow rate, and chemical integrity.

### Key Features:
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures tank fuel levels to detect discrepancies  
- **Flow Meter**: Tracks fuel dispensing rate to identify unauthorized withdrawals  
- **pH Sensor**: Detects fuel adulteration by analyzing chemical properties  
- **GIGA Display**: Shows real-time fuel metrics on-site  
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Enables remote monitoring via cloud dashboard  
- **In-Vehicle Integration**: Alerts users to fuel theft during transit
